This project entails applying the ATLAS framework for FEVER-based fact-checking and question-answering tasks, specifically focusing on the 'Speed and Language Processing' textbook. By leveraging a distributed computing setup consisting of four GPUs, we utilized ATLAS's few-shot learning capabilities, which notably reduced the training time by 50% across a variety of fact-checking scenarios. This approach not only optimized the computational efficiency but also achieved a significant milestone in model reliability, as evidenced by the obtained 71% accuracy rate. This performance metric underscores the model's effectiveness in navigating and responding to fact-checking queries, highlighting its potential utility in educational and research contexts.
